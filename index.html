        <p>Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it. 
            You alone are enough. You have nothing to prove to anybody. 
            Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
            We may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated. You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. 
            In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.</p>
